# ReadSearchSort
Java school project where it reads in a text file into an array, searches for specific words, and sorts alphabetically. 
Also shows the time spent on each different type of search.

In this case, we are looking through the whole book, Frankenstein. 
When running this project in command line, it needs the file to open and the words you want to search for right after.
For example, ' java ReadSearchAndSort frankenstein.txt doctor the frankenstein ' will search through frankenstein.txt,
and search for the words "doctor", "the", and "frankenstein". Output is how many words of each word appear in the txt.

Side note:
My personal coding is in between the "TODO" signs marked by my professor.
